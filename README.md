# scRNA-seq Analysis of Mouse Thalamus for Cell Type Diversity Analysis and Subpopulation Structure Identification

This project presents a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of mouse thalamic tissue using Seurat. 

Briefly, this script includes quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, unsupervised clustering, and cell type annotation. Through expression-based filtering and visualization of mitochondrial and ribosomal gene content, low-quality cells and potential doublets were excluded. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and UMAP were used to visualize high-dimensional transcriptomic variation. Marker gene identification enabled the annotation of 18 transcriptionally distinct clusters representing major brain cell types such as oligodendrocytes, neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia. Comparative marker analysis suggests functional heterogeneity and biological coherence among certain clusters, shedding light on the complexity and organization of the thalamic cellular landscape.
